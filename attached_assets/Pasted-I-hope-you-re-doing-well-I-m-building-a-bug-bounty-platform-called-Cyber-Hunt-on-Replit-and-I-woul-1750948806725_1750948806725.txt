I hope you're doing well. I’m building a bug bounty platform called Cyber Hunt on Replit, and I would like to request your help implementing a small but important feature in the admin panel.

I need an **automated vulnerability grading system** that classifies security reports submitted by researchers based on severity and estimated reward value. The grading logic can be rule-based for now — for example:

- If the vulnerability is RCE or SQLi affecting admin → SV1 → $1500  
- Stored XSS affecting user → SV2 → $500  
- Reflected XSS affecting user → SV3 → $200  
- Open Redirect → SV4 → $50  

You can implement this as a reusable function that receives the vulnerability type, impact target (admin/user), and whether it allows code execution or data access, and returns severity (SV1–SV4) and suggested payout.

Ideally, I’d like to have this integrated into the admin dashboard where I can see the calculated severity level automatically before reviewing the report manually.

Also, I’d appreciate it if you could create a small, well-structured table or config file that includes a detailed and realistic list of vulnerability types along with their severity levels and recommended reward values.

The idea is to make the grading logic more professional and based on common bug bounty standards. Here's an example of how the table could look:

| Vulnerability Type             | Severity | Example Impact                              | Suggested Reward |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Remote Code Execution (RCE)   | SV1       | Full server compromise                      | $1500 – $5000    |
| SQL Injection (admin access)  | SV1       | Full database dump, login bypass            | $1000 – $3000    |
| Stored XSS (admin/user panel) | SV2       | Persistent session theft, data exfiltration | $400 – $800      |
| Reflected XSS                 | SV3       | Temporary script execution via link         | $100 – $300      |
| CSRF (settings change)        | SV3       | User tricked into changing their own data   | $150 – $400      |
| Open Redirect                 | SV4       | Redirect user to phishing domain            | $20 – $100       |
| Clickjacking                  | SV4       | Tricking user into clicking hidden elements | $20 – $80        |
| Information Disclosure        | SV3       | Leak of internal emails, tokens, paths      | $100 – $300      |

If possible, please structure this in a way that I can update it later (like in a JSON or editable table inside the admin panel).
